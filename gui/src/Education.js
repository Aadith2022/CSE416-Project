          <h2>What is Districting?</h2>
          <p>
            Districting is the process of dividing a larger area, such as a state or a country, into smaller electoral districts.
            Each district elects a representative to serve its constituents. This process significantly influences the political
            landscape, often determining which party holds power in specific areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way district lines are drawn can impact which voices are represented in government and which communities
            have their needs addressed. When done poorly, districting can result in gerrymandering, where boundaries are manipulated
            to favor one party or group over another, undermining the principle of fair representation.

          <h2>The Fair Representation Act (FRA)</h2>
          <p>
            The Fair Representation Act (FRA) is a proposed solution to the issues of unfair districting. It advocates for the
            use of multi-member districts combined with ranked-choice voting, aiming to provide fairer and more equitable representation
            across all communities, regardless of political affiliation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FRA aims to end gerrymandering and ensure that every voterâ€™s voice is heard equally. By adopting proportional
            representation and ranked-choice voting, it seeks to create a more democratic system where no votes are wasted, and all
            citizens have a meaningful role in elections.

            <h2>What are Multi-Member Districts?</h2>
            <p>
            Multi-member districts are electoral districts that elect more than one representative. Unlike single-member districts,
            where one representative is elected to serve the area, multi-member districts allow voters to choose multiple candidates
            on a ballot.
            </p>
            <p>
            This system can enhance representation by allowing for a wider array of political views and parties to gain seats,
            making it easier for minority groups to have their voices heard. Multi-member districts can be combined with ranked-choice
            voting, enabling voters to express their preferences more fully and reducing the impact of gerrymandering.
            </p>
            <p>
            The use of multi-member districts is often seen as a way to promote fairness and inclusivity in the electoral process,
            leading to a more representative democracy.

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            In many parts of the U.S., district lines are drawn to benefit specific groups, often at the expense of minority communities.
            This practice dilutes their political influence and perpetuates inequality. The FRA addresses this issue by prioritizing fairness
            and equality, ensuring that every vote has an impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding how districting works and the benefits of the FRA can empower citizens to advocate for fairer elections
            and a more representative government.
